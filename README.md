# Student Management Application

## Programming Language
In the development of the student management software on Android, the primary programming language used is **Java**. Java is a widely-used programming language for mobile app development on the Android platform. It offers a readable and efficient syntax for building Android applications and supports object-oriented programming, making it easier to create maintainable and extensible code.

## Development Tools
1. **Android Studio**: Android Studio is the primary integrated development environment (IDE) used for Android app development. It is a powerful and well-established tool provided by Google for Android app development. Android Studio features code editing, debugging, UI design, and project management capabilities.

2. **SQLite**: To manage the database in the student management application, **SQLite** is used. SQLite is a lightweight database management system suitable for mobile applications. It allows efficient data storage and querying.

3. **XML (eXtensible Markup Language)**: **XML** is used to format data and configure the user interface in the Android application. It is a text-based language that helps define the data structure of the application.

4. **Handlers**: Within the application's code, **Handler** objects are used to perform synchronous and asynchronous tasks. Handlers help developers interact with the main thread of the application safely.

## Code Topics
1. **Login**: This topic involves building a user login interface. The source code handles username and password verification while ensuring the validity of login information.

2. **Create New Class**: This topic focuses on allowing users to create new classes by entering information such as class code and class name. The source code processes and stores class information in the database.

3. **List of Classes**: In this section, a list of classes that users have created is displayed. The source code allows users to view information about the classes they have entered.

4. **Manage Students**: This topic includes managing student information. Users can add, delete, and edit student information. The source code handles these operations and ensures data consistency.

5. **SQLite Database**: An SQLite database is used to store information about classes and students. The source code manages the database, including data creation, retrieval, and updates.

6. **User Interface (UI)**: The user interface is built using XML to display information and interact with users. The source code designs the UI and connects it to data processing tasks.
